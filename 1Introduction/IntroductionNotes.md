This is going to be like learning how to program all over again. x) Aww yes!

Here are my notes for the Introduction section of the tutorial. Not sure how I feel about jotting these things down, we'll see if this note-taking method is effective. ^^

## [About this tutorial](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction#about-this-tutorial)

### Haskell is...
* purely functional 
* lazy - think of programs as transformations on data
* statically typed
* has type inference
* said to be "elegant and concise"
* (started being made in 1987; Haskell Report was published in 2003)

### Setting up!
* already have a text editor - sublime all the things!
* "download the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html), which is basically Haskell with batteries included"
'''
sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
'''
* interactive mode for GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler):
    * use the command **ghci**
    * load up your functions from a file called myfunctions.hs with **:l myfunctions** or **:r** (reload)
* example of workflow:
    * define stuff in .hs file
    * load it up, mess around with them, change .hs file
    * load it up again, and so on
